#ICU_SOLID

ICU_SOLID is an Artificial Intelligence project that my team and I are working on for a course in my 6th semester at YARSI University. This project leverages predictive AI algorithms to continuously monitor patients' Electronic Health Record (EHR) data in real time, assessing key variables to determine the likelihood of sepsis occurrence.
